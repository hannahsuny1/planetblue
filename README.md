# Planet Blue Ambassador Program
Mission from PBA: We are hoping to extract MCommunity data for the Planet Blue Ambassadors (PBAs) to add into our existing database. Once extracted, we are hoping that you can analyze the data to tell us about campus distribution of PBAs geographically and across departments in the university. It would also be helpful if you are able to automatically update the UM status of these PBAs (from student to alum for example, or previous staff no longer employed, emeritus faculty etc.)
