Project Abstract
We are hoping to extract MCommunity data for the Planet Blue Ambassadors (PBAs) to add into our existing database. Once extracted, we are hoping that you can analyze the data to tell us about campus distribution of PBAs geographically and across departments in the university. It would also be helpful if you are able to automatically update the UM status of these PBAs (from student to alum for example, or previous staff no longer employed, emeritus faculty etc.)
Problem Statement
Our current database does not include information from MCommunity, and we hope to extract MCommunity data to learn more about Planet Blue Ambassadors (PBAs).
Project Outcome
Minimum
Updated database, departmental distribution of PBAs, active PBAs still with campus affiliation (not graduated or retired)
Favorable
Map of PBA locations across campus
Skills / Abilities
data extraction, APIs, data analysis, data visualization
Additional Info
Existing Database here: Copy of UM-Ann Arbor Certified PBA Survey (Responses) for PortLab
